## Game Instructions



****** HOW TO START GAME FROM THE IDE *********


There are two ways this can be accomplished: 

1) Click the Green Arrow "build" button at the top of your intellij IDE. This will launch an additional
   window with a 700 X 300 frame. 
   
OR

2) The other way to open the game is by navigating into src/main/java/ui/Window. 
   Once inside /Window, scroll to the bottom where you'll encounter the "public static void main". Click 
   on the green arrow to the left of it, and the program will launch the 700 X 300 frame. 
   
   
-After this point, you'll no longer be needing the IDE to move forward. All instructions beyond this point
will be found below, and/or on the game.-


********** GAME INSTRUCTIONS *************

[Once the game is open, click on the 700 X 300 window and tap 'i' on your keyboard if you prefer to read the instructions there.]

1) The entire game is operated through the space bar. The only exception is the instructions section, which is accessed by tapping "i" before or after the game.
   
2) To begin the game, simply hit the space bar. 
   
3) Your "lives" and "score" will be found on the upper right hand side of the screen, once the game begins.  
   
4) 1 point is added to the "score" for each obstacle that is successfully avoided.
   
5) 1 point is removed from "lives" each time an obstacle is hit. 
   
6) If an obstacle is hit and "lives" still remain, Fitz will simply be sent to the beginning of the course
   and all points previously awarded shall remain. 
   
7) If an obstacle is hit and no "lives" remain, all points shall be erased, and the game will start over. 
   
8) To make fitz jump, hit and release the space bar quickly. 

9) To make Fitz jump even higher, quickly hit and release the space bar twice. 

10) Beware of jumping too high! If Fitz jumps outside of the frame, he will leave the orbit and a point will
    be removed from "lives". 
    
11) Once the game has finished, simply hit the space bar to play again. 
    
12 Have fun!
