## Game Instructions

Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file.  The instructions should be clear enough for any non-technical computer user to understand and follow.


1) The entire game is operated through the space bar. 
   
2) To begin the game, simply hit the space bar. 
   
3) Your "lives" and "score" will be found on the upper right hand side of the screen, once the game begins.  
   
4) 1 point is added to the "score" for each obstacle that is successfully avoided.
   
5) 1 point is removed from "lives" each time an obstacle is hit. 
   
6) If an obstacle is hit and "lives" still remain, Fitz will simply be sent to the beginning of the course
   and all points previously awarded shall remain. 
   
7) If an obstacle is hit and no "lives" remain, all points shall be erased, and the game will start over. 
   
8) To make fitz jump, hit and release the space bar quickly. 

9) To make Fitz jump even higher, quickly hit and release the space bar twice. 

10) Beware of jumping too high! If Fitz jumps outside of the frame, he will leave the orbit and a point will
    be removed from "lives". 
    
11) Have fun!
