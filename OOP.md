Object Oriented Programming Concept Questions

As you should know by now, there are 4 principles (pillars) of Object Oriented Programming.

Please write a 1-3 paragraphs explaining these 4 concepts further.  Please provide a sufficient enough explanation about these pillars, as well as some examples to illustrate the practical use cases of these principles.  Please be aware, that any copy / pasting from websites can be easily detected.  Don't do that, but rather, explain the concepts in your own words, while providing code examples of each concept.

1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is essentially the act of wrapping our data and the methods 
pertaining to the data together. In principle, the data can only be 
accessed through these methods that are tied to the class itself. These variables
that exist within the class should be hidden from the other classes in practice. 
This is achieved through a private declaration. The two fundamental pieces
of encapsulation include: variables declared as a private class, and setter/getter methods to 
revise or retrieve the data.

2. Inheritance

Inheritance is the concept of one class acquiring all the properties
of another class. This allows the receiving class to have full access
of all the various methods that are featured in the other class. Whenever a
class receives properties from a another class, the receiving class is 
acknowledged as the child being the class. The class that sends the data
to the receiving class is the parent class. Inheritance allows us to manage
the data that's being passed and helps us target the classes that we wish 
to access information with.

3. Abstraction

Abstraction, in its true form -- dealing with ideas -- is a fair relation to
its usage in OOP. It's the idea of providing methods, that can be seen as ideas,
and making them available to the classes that can not only utilize the ideas of the abstract
class, but also customize them into their own personal needs. One thing to consider is that 
any class that's declared abstract cannot be instantiated. The child class can be 
seen as an extension and expansion of the abstract class.

4. Polymorphism
   
Polymorphism is the concept of an object being able to assume various
forms. A clean example of polymorphism is when is employed to refer to 
a child class. To add even further texture to this concept, an example of
multiple inheritance perfectly encapsulates what polymorphism is all about. 

If X is an interface and Y is a public class, we can make the z class polymorphic
by extending it to the Y class and implementing it to the X class. This creates
an instance of multiple inheritance, as mentioned above. Now Z has access
to qualities and methods that are accessible in the x and y classes. Polymorphism
is a powerful tool used in OOP and allows us to keep our code dry in a lot of ways.
