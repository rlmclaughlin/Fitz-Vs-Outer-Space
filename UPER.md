<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
    
    I will need to create a game that keeps track of multiple states, features a coherent objective, and abides
to a set of rules. I intend to use a GUI, so my problem will also require attention to a visual element. Along
the way, testing will play a crucial role, as well as OOD practices. These could act as a guide for the upcoming 
methods I need to build and how to properly organize it. 

My game shall feature a Cat as the main character. This cat will need to avoid various objects along the way. 
If the cat makes contact with the objects, then it will lose a point from a "lives" field. I will also keep 
a score that keeps track of how many objects were avoided. The goal will be to get as many points as possible,
before all of the characters lives are exhausted. Additional features will likely come to mind once the coding process
begins. 

It's important that I make something interesting but not too complicated considering there's only a week, and
I have no previous experience with a GUI. 

Another part of the problem that is worth consideration is that I will need some type of way
to create my characters and the setting.

This problem will require Java, Maven, JUnit, and a GUI.

    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>

For the visual aspect of the game, I intend to mainly utilize AWT. I understand that it's a heavy weight 
component, however, after conducting exhaustive research, AWT's syntax feels the most comfortable and 
realistic. I find the various methods built within the classes to be entirely intuitive and easy to remember. 
I need something that I can intuit quickly due to the limited time available. 

For the first day or two, I don't even plan on touching the capstone project. Instead, i'm going to invest
all of my time studying and mastering awt. I want to ensure that I have a strong understanding of it before
I begin. My goal for those first two days is to make a very simplified mock version of the capstone game, so
I can see if my objective is realistic.
